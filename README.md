Applicant Data Processing ScriptThis Python script is designed to process applicant data from an Excel file, group applicants by geographical region and career preference, and save the results into a new multi-sheet Excel file. It is specifically tailored for use within a Google Colab environment.FeaturesReads applicant data from the first sheet of an uploaded Excel file.Assigns applicants to one of three major regions (EMEAI, AMER, APAC) based on a comprehensive list of countries.Includes a specific sheet for applicants whose country could not be mapped to a known region.Groups applicants from known regions by their assigned region and career preference.Creates separate sheets in the output Excel file for the original data, unknown regions, and each unique region/preference combination.Generates a timestamped filename for the output Excel file and suggests a name for a corresponding Google Sheet upon manual upload.Handles variations in country naming and whitespace (case-insensitive matching).RequirementsPython (This script is written for a Google Colab environment, which provides Python).pandas library (pip install pandas)openpyxl library (pip install openpyxl) - for writing .xlsx files.Google Colab environment (for file upload/download functionality).How to UseOpen the script in Google Colab: Copy and paste the provided Python code into a new Colab notebook cell.Run the cell: Execute the code cell.Upload your Excel file: A file upload dialog will appear. Click the button and select your applicant data Excel file (.xlsx or .xls).Monitor the output: The script will print progress messages indicating:Successful file upload.Detected sheet names.Data loading status.Region assignment progress.Any country names that were not recognized (mapped to 'Unknown').Grouping process.Writing of each sheet to the output Excel file.Confirmation that the file has been saved to the Colab file system.Download the output file: Once processing is complete, the script will indicate that the file has been saved to the Colab file system. Click the folder icon on the left sidebar in Colab to open the file browser. Navigate to the location where you uploaded your original file. Find the generated Excel file (it will have a timestamp like [your_original_filename]_[timestamp]_sorted.xlsx), right-click on it, and select Download.Input File FormatThe script expects an Excel file with at least two specific columns:What Country are you located in ? (This column is used to determine the geographical region).Grow with Google Career Preference: (This column is used for grouping within regions).Ensure these column headers in your Excel file exactly match the strings specified in the country_col and preference_col variables in the script, including any punctuation or spacing.Output FileThe script generates a new Excel file named [your_original_filename]_[timestamp]_sorted.xlsx. This file will contain the following sheets:Original Data: A copy of the data from the first sheet of your input file.Unknown Region: Contains all rows where the country listed in the 'What Country are you located in ?' column could not be matched to any of the defined regions (EMEAI, AMER, APAC).[Region] - [Preference]: Multiple sheets, each containing applicants belonging to a specific region (EMEAI, AMER, or APAC) and a specific career preference.Regional GroupingThe script uses predefined sets of country names to assign applicants to one of three regions: EMEAI, AMER, or APAC. The matching is case-insensitive and attempts to handle some common variations in country names.EMEAI: Includes countries typically located in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India.AMER: Includes countries typically located in North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America.APAC: Includes countries typically located in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australasia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of South Asia (excluding India).Refer to the EMEAI_COUNTRIES, AMER_COUNTRIES, and APAC_COUNTRIES sets within the script code for the full list of countries included in each region.Troubleshooting: Unrecognized CountriesIf the script reports "Countries not mapped to a known region (Unknown)", it will print a list of the exact country names from your data that it did not recognize. To resolve this:Check for typos: Carefully compare the printed country names with the names in the script's _COUNTRIES sets. Look for spelling errors or extra spaces.Add missing countries: If a country name is correctly spelled but not in the script's lists, you can add it to the appropriate _COUNTRIES set within the Python code. Ensure you add the name exactly as it appears in your data.Correct in Excel: Alternatively, you can correct the country names in your original Excel file to match the names already present in the script's lists.After making corrections (either in the script or your Excel file), rerun the script from the beginning.
